# Customizable Document Tracking System

## Overview

The Customizable Document Tracking System is a modern, microservices-based platform designed for organizations to manage, track, and customize document workflows efficiently and securely. Built with Spring Boot and leveraging **PostgreSQL** as the sole database, this system empowers organizations to define flexible, multi-step pipelines for document movement, organize files according to their unique structures, and ensure secure, auditable handoversâ€”including mobile/web-based verification through QR codes or hash-codes.
